# Flexible-Network

A Python library / cli-tool to achieve advanced network automation scenarios with few lines of code

<br>

## Features

* Ability to detect errors when executing commands on network devices
   * When executing commands you get a `dict` of output similar to what you get when executing commands on Linux machines [check the `execute` method](#execute)
   * Which gives you the power to use ***Python conditionals*** when automating network devices.
