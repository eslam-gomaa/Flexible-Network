# Flexible-Network

A Python library / cli-tool to achieve advanced network automation scenarios with few lines of code

## Features

* Ability to detect errors when executing commands on network devices
   * When executing commands you get a `dict` of output similar to what you get when executing commands on Linux machines [check the `execute` method](https://eslam-gomaa.github.io/Flexible-Network/terminal_class_methods/#execute)
   * Which gives you the power to use ***Python conditionals*** when automating network devices.

* Multi-Vendor
   * Use a unified way to automate different types of devices from different vendors [ Check the list of supported vendors (_to be documented_) ]

* Backup config, with different storage options including `local storage` & `S3` (_including_ Openstack object storage) [[ Check the list of supported backup storage ]](https://eslam-gomaa.github.io/Flexible-Network/Docs/ConfigBackup-storage/config-backup-storage)

* Integrations with different external APIs that gives more flexibility & efficiency to your scripts  [[ Check the list of supported integrations ]](https://eslam-gomaa.github.io/Flexible-Network/integrations)
